# MIS 3371 – Transaction Processing Systems I

## Description
Front-end web development coursework focused on building form-based transaction systems using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, progressing from static forms to dynamic, stateful client-side applications.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (external stylesheets)
- JavaScript (external modules)
- Fetch API
- Browser Cookies
- Local Storage

## Repository Contents
- HW1: Structured patient registration form with external CSS and basic submission flow
- HW2: Enhanced validation and review display using HTML patterns and JavaScript-assisted checks
- HW3: Real-time, on-the-fly JavaScript validation with dynamic error messaging and controlled submit logic
- HW4: Persistent user experience using Fetch API, cookies, local storage, iFrames, and fixed UI elements

## Key Features
- Form-based data capture for business and medical workflows
- Real-time field validation triggered on input, focus, and blur events
- Persistent inline error messaging that updates dynamically
- External JavaScript files for modular validation and logic separation
- Conditional submit button enabled only when all validation checks pass
- Fetch API used to dynamically load shared content (e.g., state lists, options)
- Cookie-based user recognition with expiration and opt-in “Remember Me” behavior
- Local storage used to persist non-sensitive form data across sessions
- iFrame integration for embedded internal or external content
- Fixed header/footer to protect key UI elements from scrolling
- Clean, structured layout with predefined space for prompts and warnings
